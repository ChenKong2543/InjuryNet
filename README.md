# AI-Driven Medical Image Analysis for Sports Injury Diagnosis and Prevention

## Overview
Sports-related injuries present significant challenges in diagnosis, prevention, and rehabilitation, often requiring precise assessments across multiple imaging modalities. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to variability. To address these limitations, this repository proposes an **AI-driven framework** that integrates **deep learning**, **biomechanical modeling**, and **adaptive decision-making** for injury prediction and rehabilitation optimization.

The framework introduces the **Biomechanically-Informed Neural Network (BINN)**, which fuses kinematic, physiological, and performance data using **attention mechanisms**, enhancing both interpretability and predictive accuracy. BINN processes motion capture data through convolutional and recurrent layers to extract meaningful biomechanical patterns, assessing movement efficiency and injury risk.

Additionally, the **Adaptive Sports Medicine Strategy (ASMS)** dynamically adjusts injury risk predictions and rehabilitation strategies in real-time by continuously integrating new physiological and biomechanical data. By leveraging self-attention and multimodal data fusion, ASMS optimizes athlete monitoring and intervention planning.

The framework has been evaluated on multiple datasets, including **CamVid**, **MSRA10K**, **DUT-OMRON**, and **NYU Depth V2**. The proposed approach enhances injury risk assessment and provides personalized rehabilitation recommendations, ensuring optimal recovery and performance.
